CNCUtil
=======


A set of Ruby scripts to generate gcode. Originally written by Joe Ellsworth, more info can be found at cncutil.org.

I will try to maintain this project here and provide any needed updates as they come up.

Joe checks this email about once a month, but anything that needs to be addressed to him can be sent to info@cncutil.org. I am sure he would accept donations, thanks, stories on how this library helped you etc. Anything regarding patches and updates can be addressed here on github.

I will be adding a link to his original documentation shortly, and most likely update it and add to it as needed.

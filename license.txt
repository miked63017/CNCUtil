source code and any related executable for any purpose.   You may

Author any payment.  Author specifically prohibits any use of the library that
may result in an implied warranty or guarantee on behalf of Author.   

We strongly discourage the use of the library in any situation where a
malfunction could cause risk of injury, death or loss of property.  CNC
Machines are power machines with movement in multiple axis.  It is 
the responsibility of the end user to verify the correct behavior of 
the GCODE prior to using it with real machines.

This original license must remain in any redistributed versions
of products that contain any part of the library.   The intent is that

Author reserves the rights to change the license terms at any point in 
the future however prior versions will still be usable under the terms
contained in the license.text file they where downloaded with.

If for any reason the limitation of liabilit for any reason for any user then 
the original grant of license is auy and no warranty clause 
above is proven to be unenforceabletomatically revoked for all 
users.
